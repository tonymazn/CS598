CS598 Final Project - Molecular Property Prediction
-
Traditional dru discovery takes long time (usually 5 to 10 years) and spends billion dollars on it, and there are four drug discovery task under drug discoery:
* Molecular Property Prediction:
  molecule and the ouput is predict the drug's properties.

* Drug Reposition:
  input is drug molecules and proteins, DL model will predict the affinity score.

* Drug-Drug Interaction:
  input is two different drugs and we want to utilize DL model to predict the interactions between them. Experts will test differenct drug-drug before the drug to release.

* De Novo Design:
  reverse of Molecular Property Prediction.

Deep learning usually can help the first two tasks: Molecular Property Prediction and Drug Reposition. Because there are some limitations (such as time ) for the final project, we will only focus on one task: Molecular Property Prediction.

We develop Molecular Property Prediction by a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
